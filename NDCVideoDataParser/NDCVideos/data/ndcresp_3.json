Thanks to .NET Core, we can now host .NET applications on Windows, Linux and even the Mac! So how does it work? What does it look like? And why would I want to do it?\nLet’s take a .NET Core app through its lifecycle, and see how to create it, and what tools we need to test and debug. We’ll also see how we host a web app without IIS, and how to deploy in a world of Docker and

to C++ Template Metaprogramming - Sasha Goldshtein","description":"Template metaprogramming (TMP) is an extremely important technique in modern C++. First, TMP can be used as a precursor to C++17 Concepts, in order to check constraints and produce clear error messages when a template parameter doesn't adhere to its specified constraints. Second, TMP can be used to pick an algorithm implementation based on the template type provided -- thus enabling optimizations for specific types.\nFinally, TMP can be used to introspect C++ types at compile-time and generate compile-time constructs that save time or enable fully-compile-time computation. In this talk, we will review a collection of techniques and examples for using TMP in your libraries and application code. You are expected to understand basic template syntax and template specialisation, and we will build the rest as we go along.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704553","duration":3391,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Why, yet another language, but my perl/python/.. does all the things? Well, it does. But go has a few things that make it super sweet, is web-scale and real fun to use!

Testing in Python with Cosmic Ray - Austin Bingham","description":"Mutation testing is a technique for systematically mutating source code in order to validate test suites. It works by making small changes to a program’s source code and then running a test suite; if the test suite passes on mutated code then a flag is raised. The goal is to check that a system’s test suite is sufficiently powerful to detect a large class of functionality-affecting changes, thereby helping ensure that the system functions as expected. Mutation testing is a fascinating topic with great potential that has valuable lessons for the broader software development community.\nI’ll begin this talk with a description of the theory behind mutation testing. We’ll look at how it works and the benefits it can provide. We’ll also consider some of the practical difficulties associated with the technique, including long runtimes and certain difficult classes of mutants. I’ll then move into an analysis of Cosmic Ray, a tool for mutation testing in Python. I'll demonstrate using Cosmic Ray to locate untested code not detected by traditional coverage techniques in an open source library – with surprising results.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319754","duration":2985,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Web Apps & .NET: What are your options? - Phil Leggetter","description":"Real-time is becoming the life blood of applications. Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Google Docs and many more apps have increased user expectation to demand real-time features. Features such as Notifications, activity streams, real-time data visualisations, chat or collaborative experiences instantly keep users up to date and enable them to work much more effectively. So, how do you build these sorts of features with .NET?\nThis talk will cover the benefits of moving away from polling to push, the options you have with .NET web application to do this and when adding real-time features to your apps, and the pros and cons of each to help choose which is the best solution for you.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319753","duration":3293,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

with Mind Reading: Using EEG and Machine Learning to Perform Lie Detection - Jennifer Marsman","description":"Today, we have the technology to “read minds” (well, EEG waves!). Using an EPOC+ headset from Emotiv, I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions. I fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying. In this session, I will share my results on this “lie detector” experiment.\nI will show my machine learning models, data cleaning process, and results, along with discussing the limitations of my approach and next steps/resources. This session will be a fun look inside your brain waves along with demonstrations of data processing and predictive analytics. Attendees will gain exposure to the Emotiv EPOC+ headset and Azure Machine Learning.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319752","duration":3373,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

We'll talk about the different roles a developer can, and probably will, have in a lifetime, how to handle them, how to prevent some of them and how to get to the ones you want faster. In short, how to manage your career like a proper project and not just wing it all the time. I'll claim to have picked up some insight in a few different roles, warn you against some of my stupid mistakes and share some stories.\nAll in all you should get some inspiration and tools to help you decide where to go and how to get there.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319747","duration":3845,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/171319747?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Where do you want to go today? - Glenn F.

JavaScript to ES6 and using TypeScript as a shortcut - Chris Heilmann","description":"ECMAScript* (insert 6, 2015, 7, 2016, whatever here) is a hot topic and rightfully in the spotlight. After 15 years of weird ups and downs we now have a ratified version of the language that powers the web. ES6 answers many demands developers had and our products need, but it still suffers from the issue that not all runtimes support it.\nInstead of waiting for everyone to upgrade or blocking out users we have the option to transpile or to choose a subset of JS to achieve compliance with our needs and wants. In this talk Chris Heilmann shows the pros and cons of these approaches.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319745","duration":3079,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

changed. Open source plays a key role when it comes to innovation. Whether you run application servers like JBoss or container platforms like Docker or OpenShift or using PaaS platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Microsoft Azure is a great place to deploy and run such workloads.\nJoin me to learn about Microsoft’s strategy around open source in Azure, hear me describe and demonstrate platform features that help build great apps to combine the power of platform-native features with the value of open source innovation. Learn how our partnerships such as with Red Hat help extend the value of Microsoft Azure even

An Amazing Second Language for .NET Developers - Michael Kennedy","description":"The modern software development landscape is a terrain of many platforms and technologies. Gone are the days where simply knowing one technology really really well is sufficient to stay on the cutting edge. We are expected to write web-based applications, mobile applications, cross-platform applications and so on. Even as we know we should learn more and branch out, that choice is increasingly difficult as the technology options explode.\nThis talk will give you one very solid choice that is familiar to .NET developers: Python. It may seem like a very different language and ecosystem when compared to .NET but just below the surface, there are many more similarities than there are differences. For .NET's Entity Framework, Python has SQLAlchemy. For .NET's ASP.NET MVC, Python has The Pyramid Web Framework. The list goes on and on.\n\nCome learn why your team should learn Python as a complementary language to .NET.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319736","duration":3628,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

different way than we .NET devs are used to. They have been using sounds, I mean tools, like Gulp and Grunt to do their bidding.\nNow .NET developers can get also Gulp and Grunt their way through Visual Studio and automate a lot of the tasks that you thought we impossible to do. In this talk, Chris will take you through Gulping your front end and Grunting out your projects.

don’t need JavaScript for that! - Ben Ilegbodu","description":"We have been using JavaScript toolkits like jQuery for nearly a decade to make manipulating the DOM easier as we create our highly-interactive web apps. New features in HTML5 & CSS3 should’ve made old development strategies obsolete, and yet we’re still using jQuery to do things better suited for HTML5 & CSS3. Why? Well, old habits die hard.\nIn this session, let’s look at ways we used to build interactivity in JavaScript and see how we can transform them into more optimal solutions using plain old HTML and CSS. We’ll discuss CSS3 transitions & animations, new HTML5 attributes, and other “tricks” to offload JavaScript functionality to the browser’s rendering engine for more performant web applications. Whether you’re a seasoned JavaScripter or just getting started, you’ll leave the session with fresh ideas to work with.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319733","duration":3369,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

to become Agile without Scrum or Kanban - Kjell Ljøstad","description":"This is NOT a talk about Scrum or Kanban. The Agile Manifesto is all about communication, interaction, collaboration and building trust. Yet when most companies decide to go agile, they focus on implementing some rigid process that they don't yet fully understand, and they have a hard time getting it to work. We go back to the core of the Agile ideology. We will talk about how you can use relational skills to improve communication, get team members engaged and build trust.\nAgile initiatives tend to become a matter limited to the developers, and it is often hard to engage other parts of the organisation?. In this workshop you will learn what make teams work efficiently and the basics of how you can get the whole organisation to cooperate better. By building relations and trust between people, working on how they communicate and how they interact with each other, you will build the foundation of a truly agile organization.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nMost of us have experiences from both good and bad teams. It is often hard to point out why things turned out the way they did. After this talk you will know what make teams more efficient and increase your awareness of the things that make your team dysfunctional.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319731","duration":3437,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

refactoring using static analysis - Bjørn Einar Bjartnes","description":"Decoupling legacy code bases is not only hard, but often we don’t even have a clear idea of the current couplings that exist in our system. Without a clear overview of the current state we can’t make sound decisions on what we should do to improve. This fact leads to refactorings that are subjective, these refactorings might not yield value except for some subjective measure of “less ugly”.Refactoring with a purpose.\nI would argue reading code is like walking around in the forrest, enjoying the small details - the scale is 1:1. Static analysis can draw maps from a higher perspective, which is critical for strategic thinking.\n\nBy using static analysis we can make a map of the current couplings in our system, make a plan for refactorings based on that map, and verify that we have obtained the goals we set out to accomplish by re-running the analysis. This can make refactoring easier, cheaper and yield code-bases that can be proven to be more modular. Using examples from NRK TV (tv.nrk.no and psapi.nrk.no) I will demonstrate, using NDepend, how to analyze unwanted couplings and make rules to make sure they never again will appear in your code base.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319727","duration":3087,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

closer look into VSTS Build and Release Management - Rene van Osnabrugge","description":"With the release of TFS 2015 the new Build system was introduced. The changes compared to the old XAML build system are spectacular. It is now cross-platform, fast, light weight and task based.\nThe same concepts apply to the new Release Management tooling that is available in Visual Studio Team Services and that will eventually flow in to the on-premise product.\n\nIn this session we take a close look into the new build ad release system and talk about how you can benefit from them in your daily workflow.

the chain asynchronously - Daniel Marbach","description":"Different variations of the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be found in middleware like OWIN and ASP.NET MVC. They all share a common approach: nesting functions inside functions, also known as functional composition. In this talk, we’ll build the Chain of Responsibility from scratch, apply it to a message pump for a service bus library and combine it with Async / Await to unleash the full power of asynchronous I/O. Join this talk to learn how async and recursion plays together. Discover how composition allows changing behavior at runtime. Finally, float state into your Chain of Responsibility so that you don’t sacrifice thread safety. Break the Chain of Responsibility with me.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319725","duration":3742,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Talks: Iver Dihle Skjervum, Stephane Erbrech, Cecilie Haugstvedt & David Kai Christen Kristensen","description":"Iver Dihle Skjervum: REST was good, but now it’s time to move on.\nThe frontend industry never seems to stop moving, and more and more of our applications goes from traditionally server-based applications to heavy client-side applications.\n\nOur favorite way of communication with the server has been through REST-endpoints. But what happens when the data we need on the client is some kind of nested resources, and more than a list of items? We can for each element in our list do a new query to get additional data, or we create custom endpoints on the server which get exactly the data we need, and we probably just use the endpoint this one time as well. None of these approaches seem to be a way we want to go.\n\nSo what’s the alternative? Facebook released GraphQL as an alternative to REST, which allows the client to specify which data it needs from the server, and how the data is related to other resources on the server in one simple query.\n\nThis talk will give an introduction to GraphQL, and explain briefly how to do data fetching “the facebook way”\n\nStephane Erbrech: Predictable CI builds\nBy now most development teams use continuous integration, and understand its importance. Some have even moved to continuous delivery. But how often do you find yourself fighting it a failing build (or deployment), that works on your local machine? in 10 minutes, I'll suggest an approach that will let you trust the build server again, and be confident that what works on you machine will work in CI and deployment.\n\nCecilie Haugstvedt: Testing for accessibility without breaking the bank\n§ 14 in the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act require that all new ICT solutions in Norway should be universally designed from 1 July 2014.Existing ICT solutions should be universally designed from 2021. To ignore this or postpone the subject until late in the development process can not only be expensive but will often result in sub-optimal solutions. In this lightning talk I'll give some tips on how to discover problems with universal design as early as possible and build accessible solutions available for all without breaking the bank. The talk is based on real-life experiences from IT-projects in the public sector.\n\nDavid Kai Christen Kristensen: Mqtt - a protocoll for IoT\nMQTT is a lightweight messaging protocoll over TCP/IP. Designed for connections to remote locations network bandwidth is limited, it is ideal for many IoT scenarios.\n\nLeveraging the publish subscribe paradigm, it allows for for two way communication between devices without the need for mechanisms such as long polling.\n\nWe give you a brief overview of the protocoll, and discuss some common IoT scenarios in which it can be used.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171319723","duration":2402,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Integration for Open Source Projects with Travis CI - Kyle Tyacke","description":"Continuous Integration (CI) can save you time, reduce the hassles of managing open source projects, improve the overall quality of your code, and make merging a joy. But it can be a bit difficult to understand at first and a chore to setup and manage.\nIn this talk we’ll break down the concepts of Continuous Integration, and take a look at Travis CI, a free, hosted solution that makes it extremely easy to add continuous integration to your open source projects. Once we have a handle on the basics, we’ll move on to more advanced topics including sending build notifications, running unit tests, linting, and automatically deploying successful builds. While the example project used in this presentation will be written in Node, the concepts discussed, as well as Travis CI itself, can be applied to almost any language, bringing value to developers from all backgrounds. Come learn how to make managing your open source projects fun again, with continuous integration and Travis CI!","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317281","duration":2854,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

once, run everywhere\" is not a myth - Mahesh Krishnan & Cristian Prieto","description":"Web, mobile, and cross platform desktop applications have generally required writing the same application more than once. Up until now, that is...\nIn this session, Mahesh Krishnan and Cristian Prieto, Microsoft MVPs from Australia show how you can write a web application, and use the same code to run as a native desktop application - all with just a few tweaks. They will start with a simple web application using HTML/ReactJS and then using Electron native, will run it as cross platform desktop application that can run in Mac, Windows and Linux.\n\nIn case you wondering, this is how Visual Studio Code and GitHub's Atom were written.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317276","duration":3507,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Full Stack Developers, and Other Legendary Creatures - Dylan Beattie","description":"Once upon a time, when the web was young, phones were dumb and people still thought progressive JPEGs were a pretty neat idea, there was a legendary race of beings known as... THE WEBMASTERS. They were brave, they were bold. Armed with a 56k modem and a stack of O'Reilly books, the webmasters were fearless in their ongoing quest, driven by one humble vision... to connect the entire world together. Using Netscape Navigator.\nOf course, that was a long time ago, and nobody really believes the stories any more. Some say the webmasters are gone. Some say they never existed in the first place - it was just a bunch of marketing people with delusions of grandeur. But a few, a select few, believe they changed. They evolved. They learned new skills, they embraced new technology... and the Legend of the Full Stack Developer was born.\n\nThe history of software development is rich with tales of extraordinary individuals, whose knowledge of their own systems was absolutely unrivalled. But here in 2016, in a world where distributed systems, machine learning and autoscaling cloud systems are ubiquitous and the average web app uses three JavaScript frameworks, four server-side languages and six different kinds of caching technology, does it really make any sense to talk about full stack developers? Are we clinging to outdated paradigms, nostalgic for the simple days when one person really could know all the answers - or does overspecialisation represent a genuine threat to the established discipline of software development? And if it does - should we be resisting it, or embracing it as a change that's long overdue?\n\nDylan Beattie wrote his first web page in July 1992 (11 months after Tim Berners-Lee wrote HIS first web page), and he's been building websites ever since. In this talk, Dylan will reflect on the history of the World Wide Web, exploring what we've learned - and forgotten - along the way. He'll share lessons learned over a quarter century of building sites, writing code, designing systems, hiring developers, managing teams and delivering working software, and take a speculative look at the next 25 years of the web, and how it's going to keep on changing the world.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317272","duration":3402,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

BI for the Developer: Integrate, Embed, Extend - Peter Myers","description":"In this session you will learn about the exciting new generation of Power BI delivering access to data and insights with Software as a Service (SaaS), and specifically what can be achieved by the software developer. You will learn that the new generation of Power BI enables developers to configure real-time dashboard scenarios, create custom visualizations and also integrate rich analytics in application experiences by embedding Power BI reports into we apps.\nSeveral demonstrations will illustrate how to configure real-time dashboards that programmatically push data to the Power BI service by using the Power BI REST API, and also how to integrate Power BI experiences with applications.\n\nThis session will be of interest to architects and software developers looking to understand and evaluate the developer capabilities of Power BI.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317271","duration":3504,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

a Live Programming Tool with Roslyn - Josh Varty","description":"For decades programming has been divided into two separate worlds. On one hand you've got \"Edit time\" where you write your code. On the other you've got \"Run time\" where you run your code and see what you've messed up.\nLive programming challenges with paradigm by merging the two. What if we could see exactly what our code did the moment we wrote it? In this talk we'll explore a few live programming environments available for other languages as well as Alive: Live Programming for Visual Studio.\n\nWe'll discuss the motivations for live programming, and how Roslyn enabled a team of two newly graduated computer engineers to build this powerful tool.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317263","duration":2536,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

We'll look at why breaking all the corporate rules might be a good thing, we will see what happens if you stop defining roles, how your responsibilities dictates your mindset, how standardization kills both innovation and exploration and we will also dig into what happens when you stop trying to make people follow your

Things Git Can Do (that none of the GUIs have ever told you about) - Enrico Campidoglio","description":"It took less than a decade for Git to become the de-facto standard in version control systems. Most people who use it praise its speed. Some appreciate its flexibility. Everyone criticizes its unwarranted complexity. In order to make Git more approachable, a number of GUIs have been developed on top of it. While many of them have contributed to its widespread popularity, they all share a common design flaw: sacrificing Git's true potential on the altar of user-friendliness.\nRegardless of how many features these tools may have, no graphical metaphor can effectively represent what was conceived for the command line. In this session I'll demonstrate exactly what Git can do for you that none of the GUI tools ever tells you about. Moving chunks of commits between branches in a single command, custom history visualizations and data recovery are only some of the things I'll demonstrate, all 100% from the command line.\n\nIf you're using Git through a GUI, you're missing out. Let me show you why.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317261","duration":3894,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

expectancy of our code actually improving or is this just something we like to tell ourselves to sleep better at night? When is it appropriate to call time of death on our code? Maybe when it's legacy? But what is legacy code?\n\nThree hundred developers have answered these questions in a survey that will be presented in this session.

Programming for the Object Oriented - Øystein Kolsrud","description":"Functional programming is about how to model problems, not about what programming language you use. Most modern programming languages have taken inspiration from the functional programming paradigm and have implemented features for making functional modelling easier.\nTo be able to fully leverage the power of languages such as C#, it is therefore necessary to have an understanding of functional programming as well as other paradigms such as object orientation. This presentation gives an introduction to Haskell and compares it to the features provided in C# that have been influenced by concepts from the functional world. In particular, it aims to illustrate how a functional approach to solving problems differs from an object oriented approach.\n\nThis presentation assumes no previous experience of functional programming. In fact, its intended target audience is software developers who have been working with imperative or object oriented programming, but never had the opportunity to investigate what functional programming is all about.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317258","duration":3337,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

parameters and a returns value that is easy to verify.\nWriting unit tests for multi-threaded code is harder still.\nOver the years I discovered useful patterns that helped me to test multi-threaded and asynchronous code and enabled the creation of deterministic, simple and robust unit tests.\n\nCome learn how to test code that uses concurrency and parallelism – so that the excuses of not writing

Is Neat But What Can You Actually Do With It? - Rob Conery","description":"Working with Elixir is intoxicating. The syntax is clean, pattern matching is thrilling, and the power of the Erlang VM underneath is mind-blowing. But what can you actually build with it? What patterns do you use… what tools? Are Phoenix and Ecto my only choices for web and data frameworks?\nIn this talk Rob Conery will share his experience migrating a Ruby on Rails application to Elixir, and the choices he faced along the way. We’ll dive into Agents, Supervision Trees, JSONB and potential life on Mars as we figure out the best way to structure an application in Elixir that works great both now and into the future.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317253","duration":2823,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Most of the time, it's not even sufficiently advanced. Like everything else in our world, the people you work with and the products they build are subject to the fundamental laws of nature. In this talk, Pieter Hintjens and Dylan Beattie will explore the laws of our universe - from Amdahl to Zip, from Newton's Laws of Motion to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, from Conway to Murphy to Godwin to Moore.\nWe'll discuss how they apply to your projects, even when you want to pretend they don't, and explain why if you ignore them, your work will collapse like a badly-designed

Don't Know Node.js - Azat Mardan","description":"This talk will give a sneak peak of the most interesting and powerful Node.js features. Node.js is quickly capturing the programming world not just in web, but in IoT, drones, robots and embedded systems. Do you use Node tool such as Grunt, Gulp or Webpack to built your front-end assets. Do you use an HTTP server built with Express? Do you generate code using Yeoman? But do you really know Node? If you are a geek like most of us, then you’d appreciate this presentation. You’ll become more confident in the internals of Node.js and understand how certain things work. Node.js is fast and scalable web-oriented non-blocking I/O built on top of Google Chrome V8 engine. Almost every web developer uses Node or Node-based tools to some extent. However, Node has some really powerful features worth knowing.\nThis talk dives deep into the core mechanisms of the Node.js platform and some of its most interesting features such as:\n\nEvent Loop: Brush-up on the core concept which enables the non-blocking I/O\nStreams and buffers: Effective way to work with data\nProcess and global: How to access more info\nEvent emitters: Crash course in the event-based pattern\nClusters: Fork processes like a pro\nAsyncWrap, Domain and uncaughtException: Handling async errors\nC++ addons: Contributing to the core and writing your own C++

Into the Zero Downtime Deployment World - Tugberk Ugurlu","description":"Continuous delivery is a huge step forward in our ability to rapidly deliver features and value to the users of distributed applications, but it comes with a cost and a responsibility. Most modern web applications need to be highly available, and this also means that it should be up during the deployments. Dealing with zero-downtime deployments is a challenge, and there is no easy solution. Moreover, the solutions available vary based on the number of integrated clients, which parts of the World it addresses, how many active users it has... Isn’t there a simple way to figure out how to get there?\nJoin me to get into the details of the key steps on your path to zero downtime deployments. Learn about the patterns, practices and techniques that make it easier, such as semantic versioning and blue/green deployments. We’ll also walk through an end-to-end demo of how a high traffic web application can survive the challenge of deployments.\n\nWhat seemed insurmountable at the start of the session will be practical and applicable by the time we’re finished, and you should be able to see how to start moving your production application close to the zero-downtime gold standard.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317249","duration":3433,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Big Time-series Data in the Cloud - Tomas Petricek","description":"Working with small time-series data is fun. You can easily load daily Microsoft stock prices into memory and find the most successful year it its history. Or you can download average daily temperatures in your city over the last 10 years and try to spot a trend in a chart. But what if you have prices at millisecond frequency for thousands of stocks or high-resolution temperatures for the entire globe? With the right tools, working with massive time-series can feel the same as crunching through hundreds of observations in memory.\n\nIn this talk, I will show what's available if you are using R, the .NET platform and Azure. We'll use Deedle, a scalable .NET data analytics library, R type provider that makes thousands of R packages available to .NET developers and MBrace, a cloud computing framework that can easily scale your data analytics over an Azure compute cluster.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317247","duration":3618,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

living systems with hypermedia actors","description":"The sad truth is that we build software systems that are hard to change, and when we change them, they break. As usual, it's because we've forgotten that our forebears have invented the building blocks we need to build living systems: actors and hypermedia. Actors - objects done right - allow us to model resources as living, independent, concurrent things. Hypermedia enables dynamic, organic systems by providing a generic mechanism for creating associations between the live resources and presenting choices for state transitions to clients.\nIn this talk, I'll combine the two and show how you can build living systems using hypermedia actors. To compensate for using old ideas to fix today's problems, I'll use modern technology for the implementation.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317244","duration":2491,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Programming – Exploring the HoloLens - Lars Klint","description":"Virtual reality and augmented reality are terms most developers and technical enthusiasts recognise. What about “Mixed reality”? A reality that is part real world, part digital world, a reality that is enhanced with Holograms. Microsoft’s HoloLens introduces users to an entirely new way of thinking about computing.\n\nLearn how to use the Holographic Development Kit (HDK) to build completely new experiences that will blow your mind (only figuratively, I hope), and get a sense for what is possible. You will be challenged to think of how to solve problems in an entirely new way that leverage holographic projections, to provide intuitive natural interactions with the digital world.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317243","duration":3459,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Performance 2016: Myths and Truths - Christian Wenz","description":"The performance of a web site is one of the criteria used by Google and other search engines to determine the site's ranking. Various studies have shown that there is a link between performance and conversion rates. These are just two of many reasons to make performance optimization a mandatory step in your development process. However advice that was relevant a few years ago is often made obsolete by new browser versions or new technologies like HTTP/2.\nWe will cover several aspects of optimizing a site from a performance perspective, debunk some myths, and also present tools that help analyzing a web site's performance.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171317242","duration":3412,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe
