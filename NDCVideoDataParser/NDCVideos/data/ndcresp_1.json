DevOps is a mindset, which requires a lot of “soft skills” of all stakeholders in this system! And these skills are important for the success or the failure of the experiment “DevOps”!\nIn this talk we will focus on the role of communication for a DevOps team, although we will also touch psychological aspects of mindset, attitude and behavior!\nWhenever people come together, communications starts at once! You can´t stop it! In addition to the original face-to-face communication we use a lot of different communication channels like phones, chats, live webinars and emails in our modern times.\nAs communication is a very complex topic misunderstanding is part of daily our work; it is always the companion of communication. We have to spend a lot of time to deal with these misunderstandings or - what is worse - things will go wrong.\n\nThe more different characters work together in cross-functional teams like DevOps the higher the probability of misunderstanding. With release cycles getting shorter and shorter or continuous delivery, time is a very precious factor in IT projects. So why do we waste time in clearing up misunderstanding? For more success and more efficiency it will be extremely helpful to identify the bugs in your communication and eliminate them to reduce misunderstandings and save time! And we will talk about the nearly unbelievable effect on everyone´s motivation.\n\nIn this session theoretical background will be combined with best practice; the importance of further education in communication skills especially for “people from IT” to reach more efficiency will be pointed out.\n\nThe takeaways for the audience:\n\n- what is beyond organizational change and tools when doing / being DevOps\n\n- the importance of communication and the difficulties\n\n- bugs and misunderstanding\n\n- smart ways to eliminate bugs in order to create a successful and efficient communication\n\n- communication as part of culture, attitude and motivation\n\n- Best practice of slight but successful improvement of communication and the effect on everyone in a company","link":"https://vimeo.com/172411285","duration":2444,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Driver Best-Practices - Bill Gatliff","description":"Linux has a highly refined \"device model\" that excels at both managing hardware AND baffling developers. Unfortunately, the most commonly-referenced tutorials mistakenly refer to \"interfaces\", \"device nodes\", \"devices\", and \"drivers\" as though they are all interchangeable concepts---which is both misleading and incorrect.\nDon't make this same mistake yourself.In this presentation, Bill describes how he uses Linux's clear, unambiguous distinction between \"driver\" and \"interface\" to tame even the most complex device management challenges. The result: straightforward, reliable code that Just Works, even when you push it beyond its

to Azure Machine Learning: Predict Who Survives the Titanic - Jennifer Marsman","description":"Interested in doing machine learning in the cloud? In this demo-heavy talk, I will set the stage with some information on the different types of machine learning (clustering, classification, regression, and anomaly detection) supported by Azure Machine Learning and when to use each.\nThen, for the majority of the session, I’ll demonstrate using Azure Machine Learning to build a model which predicts survival of individuals on the Titanic (one of the challenges on the Kaggle website). I'll talk through how I analyze the given data and why I choose to drop or modify certain data, so you will see the entire process from data cleaning to building, training, testing, and deploying a model. You’ll leave with practical knowledge on how to get started and build your own predictive models using Azure Machine Learning.","link":"https://vimeo.com/172113451","duration":3540,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

your code towards async/await - Daniel Marbach","description":"The die is cast. Your business- and infrastructure logic will need to move gradually to asynchronous code. Changing large code-bases to async/await seems like a monumental effort. It doesn't have to be! In this talk, I show you a four-phased approach to evolving your code-base towards async/wait. In the identification phase, we classify the components which would benefit from async/await. In the exploration phase, we discover potential road blockers which might hinder the async/await adoption.\nIn the obstacle phase, we learn to redesign parts of the code to remove the previously identified road blockers. In the bring-it-together phase, we gradually move the components which benefit the most from async/await to a full asynchronous API. Small steps. No Big Bang. Join me on a journey towards async/await and learn to leverage the power of asynchronous code to embrace the cloud-first APIs of today and tomorrow.","link":"https://vimeo.com/172111826","duration":3480,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Identity 3 - Brock Allen","description":"ASP.NET Identity 3 has had a bit of an update in ASP.NET Core. To get started with this framework most developers use the Visual Studio project templates, which have historically been ridiculed for the mountains of code dumped into a new project.\nIn this session we will spend the time to understand it all (since that’s what most developers end up using). Along the way we will see features that are the same as the prior version of ASP.NET Identity, but there are some new features to point out in this updated ASP.NET Core based framework. Additionally, as the templates are examined, we will discuss changes that can be made to lock down the security of your application even more. Finally, some freestyle coding might be in order to add even more security features than what are provided out of the box.","link":"https://vimeo.com/172009501","duration":3932,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Together we will build a simple universal web application (does an initial server side render, then becomes a client side JS app) to see how you can leverage WebPack with React and Redux to completely change your view on what web development can be!\nIf you have been wondering what everyone is on about with any of these tools you must attend this session. Based on his experience using these tools in production Jake will share what building a universal web application which can be rendered initially on the server, then support time travel and hot reloading on the client looks like.\n\nThese libraries and tools are not the only ones that can give you this amazing experience though, we will finish up with your options and when to use each of these tools.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171996395","duration":3425,"width":1920,"language":"en","height":1080,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

This talk will demonstrate that there are indeed many advantages to using FP techniques such as immutability and data transformations to build your app. That theme will continue as a selection of modern application architectures are presented that codify these techniques. At the end of this talk, you will have heard the word \"function\" far too many times, but you will also have a powerful new tool in your toolbox.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171996394","duration":2999,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/171996394?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Functional Programming for Mobile Apps - Frank A.

things you need to know about Specflow - Seb Rose","description":"10 things you need to know about Specflow SpecFlow is quite a recent addition to the software development toolbox. Sometimes it feels like we’re using a hammer to drive in a screw, so in this session we’ll explore what it’s good for and when to use it. We’ll also look at what problems it doesn’t help with and when not to use it. As you might expect, I’m a huge fan of using SpecFlow, as part of a well thought out approach to Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) or Specification By Example (SBE).\nI’ve also seen the pain of organisations who have tried using SpecFlow from a pure test automation perspective, and this is one of the misapplications that we’ll talk about. We’ll look at a further 9 specific, actionable recommendations for using SpecFlow well, including how to write maintainable executable specifications, organising large suites of specifications in an accessible way, and where SpecFlow fits into an Agile development process. By the end of this session you’ll know enough to decide whether your problems are more like a screw or a nail – and whether SpecFlow is the right tool.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171950836","duration":3617,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

It’s hard to know what goes on behind the walls of another company and even harder to learn from their mistakes. At Octopus Deploy, we see a broad range of deployment strategies and techniques. Some are extremely effective, some … well, not so much.\nJoin me as I take you through a range of delivery strategies employed by development teams all over the world. How do teams overcome the challenges of delivering quality software and which techniques work in which scenarios?\n\nYou'll see everything from \"what were they thinking!\" to \"it must be black

boilerplates has exploded the last few years, making front-end development seem really intimidating to both new and seasoned developers. You seemingly have to spend days (weeks..) just to get a decent front-end project up and running.\nOr do you..?\nLet’s demystify all of these scary words and look at how you can avoid most of them and do «just-in-time» development - introducing these tools only when they are needed and actually provide value to your

scaling in a (micro)service oriented architecture - Bastian Hofmann","description":"Splitting an application up into multiple independent services can be a good way to keep it scaling and ensure stability and developer productivity in larger, growing teams. But just splitting the codebase, creating APIs and deploying the code on some servers is not enough, somehow your services need to know where and how other services are accessible. Classical approaches like hardcoding everything in every service or having a central load-balancer can quickly lead to problems in terms of scalability and maintainability.\nIn this talk I'll show how we at ResearchGate tackled this challenge. With the help of tools like Consul and haproxy we created a setup that allows us to quickly boot and shutdown services. This ensures that all servers are utilized optimally and load spikes can be reacted upon quickly and automatically.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171950821","duration":3666,"width":1920,"language":"en","height":1080,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

behalf of that user. Since those application types have access to advanced platform and OS features like cryptography and secure storage we can enable advanced features like mobile single sign-on, seamless token lifetime management and other advanced security features. The OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 hybrid flow alongside some new specification like PKCE and PoP are a perfect match for these

C++ and CLR Memory Models - Sasha Goldshtein","description":"The words \"memory model\" are known to induce fear, sleep, or even coma among the best of developers. Truly understanding the intricate relationship between the compiler, the processor, and the memory system is necessary if you plan to design low-level synchronization, write lock-free code, or even debug race conditions that are already present in your code.\nIn this deep session we will climb down into the abyss of the CLR and C++ memory models, affectionately known as SC-DRF. We will talk about volatile and atomic variables, see multiple examples of compiler- and processor-induced reorderings, and see how a lot of code we assume to be correct in fact happens to be totally broken on non-Intel processors.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171942746","duration":3712,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

To Your Microservice Via a Chat Bot, not UI - Yegor Bugayenko","description":"In most cases, it is convenient to have some human interaction with a web (micro-)service, no matter how small it is. A traditional approach would be to create an HTTP interface, where user requests will be dispatched and HTML/CSS pages must be served.\nThis approach is indeed very traditional for a web site, but not really convenient for a web service, which is not intended to be good looking, 24x7 up and running and UX-optimized. Instead, talking to a web service in a chat-bot mode would be much more convenient, both for a user and web service developer. In this session I will try to explain why chat-bot design is more preferable, what are the pros and cons.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171933096","duration":2611,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

data in intelligent transport systems - Trond Smaavik & Jørgen Abrahamsen","description":"ITS, intelligent transport systems, is about making transport more efficient, secure and environment friendly. Data from sensors along the roads, combined with data from cars and the world around it, makes it possible for you to build new and exciting services. There are a lot of datasets with such data freely available for you to use.\nThe Norwegian Public Road Administration - NPRA (Statens vegvesen) is one of the largest providers of open location based ITS data. We will show you how you through APIs can get access to data about live traffic reports, travel time, road toll, speed limits, web cameras and much more.\n\nNorwegian Public Roads Administration has recently launched a new web based map solution. We will also take a look at this solution, the experiences and challenges developing it, and what data sets that are used in it.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171927599","duration":3603,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Driven Development, Scrum, and the Wright Brothers - Jamie Dixon","description":"Do you work in an organization that uses Agile? What about Scrum? TDD? One of the signers of the Agile manifesto, Jeff Sutherland, makes a convincing argument of using scrum outside of software development in his recent book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time. A full 111 years before Sutherland published this book, the Wright Brothers practiced scrum to outmaneuver better funded and more entrenched competitors to create the first heavier-than-air flying machine that could carry humans. REPL driven development is a technique that comes to business software creation from the scientific computing community.\nIt takes the benefits of small iterations and immediate feedback and marries it with the change-proofing benefits of test-driven development. Taking the lessons of Sutherland and the Wright Brothers back to software, we will see how REPL-driven development aligns perfectly with their techniques. At the end of the session, you will know how to write code faster and better, and have a heck of a lot of fun doing it. This session will be using F# in Visual Studio 2015. If you have learned some F# and are eager to start using it in your day job, this session will use some techniques help you achieve that goal.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171927598","duration":3206,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

High-Performance Solution to Microservices UI Composition - Alexey Gravanov & Arif Wider","description":"So you have decided to go for Microservices and you want to achieve maximum autonomy for your teams. However, at the front end your services still have to be joined into a single page.Here you have two options: Either have a single UI layer which all teams depend on or let each service render its own UI and compose these UI pieces later on.\nIn the course of moving the Autoscout24 platform - one of Europe’s leading internet car portals - to an AWS-hosted Microservice architecture, we favored autonomy and therefore decided for the UI Composition approach. During this process we faced all the challenges of UI Composition, such as performance, consistency, isolation, and testing. Learn how we started off with a rather complex attempt and then managed to greatly improve and simplify our solution.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171927597","duration":3971,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

If you’ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, “I think I know what they’re talking about, but I’m not sure...”, you’re not alone. Let’s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I’ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer.\nIn this session, you’ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person’s rambling about. So, the next time you’re in conversation, you’llbe the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171926351","duration":1338,"width":1920,"language":"en","height":1080,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

NDC Oslo 2016: Yesterday’s Technology is Dead, Today’s is on Life Support - Troy Hunt","description":"Isn’t technology just awesome? Well we think it’s awesome and then a year or two later it’s old junk that for most of us, serves no further useful purposes. The technology of yesterday is rapidly becoming unrecognisable not just in the sense that it’s so different to what we use today, but a whole generation has literally never even seen a cassette tape or a rotary dial phone before.\nLooked at the other way, our present day technology was inconceivable such a short time ago. What we take for granted today was little more than a pipedream yesterday yet our lives would be unrecognisable without them. Our children could not conceive of a time without mobile phones or internet; there are adults today that have not known this time!\n\nThis talk delves into how technology is changing around us from the essential to the absurd. Technology we put in our homes, technology we carry, technology we insert inside ourselves and all of it headed for rapid obsoletion as the next inconceivable wave takes hold. As much as yesterday’s technology is dead, today’s is on life support and we’d better get ready for the next big thing.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171897425","duration":3091,"width":1920,"language":"en","height":1080,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

from a quarter of a billion breached records - Troy Hunt","description":"What motivates attackers to dump data publicly? How is it sold, traded and redistributed and for that matter, what even causes adversaries to go public with it? These are all questions I’ve dealt with over the years running the ethical data breach search service “Have I been pwned”. It’s also given me the opportunity to interact with everyone from the attackers breaching these systems to the impacted organisations to law enforcement agencies.\nIn this talk, I’ll share the lessons learned from working with more than a quarter of a billion publicly dumped records as a result of major data breaches. The talk sheds light on how this class of adversary operates and the weaknesses within organisations they continually manage to exploit. It’s a unique inside look at security from a very real world and very actionable perspective.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704683","duration":3372,"width":1920,"language":"en","height":1080,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

the Programmer: Get More Done Faster - Dave Rael","description":"Software developers have a reputation for being unlike other humans. We eat, drink, and sleep code and aren't interested in much else and aren't very good at interacting with others of our species. This may be true of a few programmers, but for most of us, it's a misguided stereotype. We're human just like everyone else. Though geeking out about a challenging technical problem gives us a charge and is an enjoyable experience, we want more from life (though we want the tech, too).\nFurther, there's a diminishing return on each hour you spend writing software each week to the point that working more can be counterproductive. Dave Rael is passionate about getting more done in less time. Come and join Dave as he takes you on a journey of how to more effectively use your chosen tools, like Visual Studio, Windows, and Powershell and how to manage your tasks so you can get your job done and live your life. Bring your laptop to play along.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704675","duration":3509,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe
