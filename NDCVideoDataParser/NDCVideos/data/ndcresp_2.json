Many hard-core developers wouldn’t even touch CSS, and even more rely on libraries to even the playing field and let us worry about the logic of our code instead of differences across browsers. This leads to bloated and hard to maintain products that slow down the web. Even worse, simply hearing that supporting various runtimes gives us the shakes as we remember the browser wars (or we pretend we do to have a quick way out).\nIn this talk Chris Heilmann will show that having two JavaScript engines for node is not extra work for us, but is a great opportunity to write better code. And that cross-browser in 2016 is not as tough as you think, if you start embracing capabilities over runtime detection.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704670","duration":2936,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Vector in Your CPU: Exploiting SIMD for Superscalar Performance - Sasha Goldshtein","description":"For more than ten years modern processors have been equipped with vector registers and instructions that can make certain algorithms four to eight times faster. In the past, it took special language intrinsics or intimate knowledge of assembly language to use them. In this talk you will learn how to take advantage of vector instructions in .NET applications using the newly released System.Numerics.Vectors library and the RyuJIT compiler that's part of .NET 4.6.\nWe will explore a variety of algorithms that can benefit from vectorization, ranging from simple 4-8x-wins like matrix multiplication and dot product, all the way to algorithms that must be refactored to benefit from vectorization because they contain inter-iteration dependencies or complex control flow.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704658","duration":3132,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

experiments in Machine Learning with F# - Mathias Brandewinder","description":"Just like traditional applications development, machine learning involves writing code. One aspect where the two differ is the workflow. While software development follows a fairly linear process (design, develop, and deploy a feature), machine learning is a different beast. You work on a single feature, which is never 100% complete. You constantly run experiments, and re-design your model in depth at a rapid pace. Traditional tests are entirely useless. Validating whether you are on the right track takes minutes, if not hours.\nIn this talk, we will take the example of a Machine Learning competition we recently participated in, the Kaggle Home Depot competition, to illustrate what \"doing Machine Learning\" looks like. We will explain the challenges we faced, and how we tackled them, setting up a harness to easily create and run experiments, while keeping our sanity. We will also draw comparisons with traditional software development, and highlight how some ideas translate from one context to the other, adapted to different constraints.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704652","duration":3541,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

C++17 and beyond - ​Mark Isaacson","description":"This talk will preview what's to come on the C++17 and C++20 horizons. We'll explore real, working, code to show how new features will both change the way you handle day-to-day problems and also push the limits of what's possible in C++. We'll talk about how these language features have been put to use in the D community, which has had years of experience with them in production code.\nTopics include:\n\nA discussion of what's likely to come in C++17 and what's being delayed to C++20\nstd::string_view and the day-to-day benefits it provides, including preventing the dreaded static initialization order fiasco\nUsing operator dot for a variety of unconventional uses, such as implementing poor-man's contracts\nUsing std::uncaught_exceptions to write a generic Transaction class\nMaking templates more accessible to the masses by using constexpr_if. We'll discuss how this is different from Concepts as well as how this can be used for Design by Introspection.\nWhere new features are neither implemented in current compilers nor implementable in terms of C++14, this talk will feature the D language as a proxy.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704648","duration":4098,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

The time has to come to release and you are brimming with confidence.\nBut once you are live the pain starts coming; deadlocks in the Db, servers that begin queuing requests and then fail, users reporting errors you have never seen.\nKeeping an application alive in production takes more than just good practices. You have to understand stability patterns like retry and circuit breaker, you have to understand what it means to be a multi-user system if you don't want deadlocks, you need to understand what happens if you lose a node and you need to know how to monitor your application in production so you can understand the pain when it hits you.\n\nIn this presentation we explore some of the key patterns you need to know to keep your application alive in production.\n\nBy the end of the session you should have a far better idea of what you need to know to stay

well-monitored? how to investigate failure cases as they happen? and how to even know something is wrong before it's too late? With logs of course. Lots of them. And then some cool stack to do stuff with it.Forter is a company with a Decision-as-a-Service product that deals with many e-commerce transactions in real time and answers a simple but hard question: \"is this a fraud attempt or not?\". And if we were wrong, we pay.\nIn this talk I will show how we are using various technologies to power our service and keep it high-available and well under control. Among the technologies I will discuss are Apache Storm, Node.js, Riemann (state machines in Clojure, yay!), collectd, D3.js and of course the ELK stack (and beats!). Some integrations which will be mentioned include PagerDuty, Slack, Jenkings and GitHub.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704643","duration":3845,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Kubernetes, a Container Cluster Manager - Ben Hall","description":"Docker in development is very different to Docker in production. When running 100s or 1000s of containers you’re faced with different concerns and problems.\nBen will introduce Kubernetes, a Container Cluster Manager originally from Google. Now an established open source project, Kubernetes helps manage your containers running on a cluster.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\n- When to implement Kubernetes\n\n- Launching a cluster\n\n- Managing mutli-host networking\n\n- Managing Secrets and Security\n\n- Running Kubernetes on Bare Metal, AWS, GCE and Azure\n\n- Auto Scaling Containers\n\n- Nomad vs Kubernetes vs Mesos vs Swarm\n\nAt the end attendees will understand the foundations of Kubernetes, when they’ll require a cluster manager and the details of running it on bare metal and in the cloud.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704635","duration":3647,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

2.0 - why the web lost and Apps won - Liam Westley","description":"In the heady days after the dotcom boom and bust, Web 2.0 arrived and created an exciting new delivery mechanism for software. Browser wars improved performance to a level where they could host fully functional applications, with easy of deployment and updating.At the same time smartphones had appeared and the first real applications were breaking cover, but they suffered from reliability, performance and discoverability issues.When Apple launched the iPhone, and the App Store it solved many of these concerns.\nWe now have easily discovered applications, streamlined deployment and high levels of usability.Is everything solved though? There are issues related to speed of updates, development costs, security, deep linking and whether the mobile platform owners are fighting back against the likes of Facebook.What is the future of apps? Who will win the platform battles?

the C++ STL Without Dynamic Memory - Dan Saks","description":"Some embedded systems have constraints that preclude using dynamically allocated memory. Some industry guidelines require safety-critical systems to avoid dynamic memory management. Many embedded developers seem to have the misconception that you can't use the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) without also using dynamic memory allocation.\nThis isn't true. Granted, some parts of the STL pretty much demand dynamic memory. However, you can use other parts very effectively with only statically and automatically allocated memory. This session explains which parts of the STL you can use without dynamic memory and how those parts can be surprisingly useful. It also presents techniques you can use to automatically detect when your program inadvertently uses dynamic allocation.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704624","duration":2744,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Executors for C++ - Detlef Vollmann","description":"Executors (or schedulers) will be a base building block in C++ for asynchronous and parallel work. Executors for asynchronisity are somehow similar to allocators for containers: They are a very important implementation aspect, but for most people they are hidden behind the scene.\nThe C++ committee faces three more or less competing proposals for executors and the hope is to have an idea how to align them into a single direction by the time of NDC Oslo 2016. Also new in the game are coroutines, which should play together with executors smoothly. This talk will present the differnces between the proposals, their common underlying mechanisms and what glue might combine the executor proposals and the coroutine mechanisms.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704621","duration":3747,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Thread Safety - Andrew Clymer","description":"When developing multi­­threaded, we need to consider thread safety when sharing state across multiple threads. These techniques require the developer to understand possible race conditions and select the cheapest synchronisation technique to satisfy thread safety.\nHowever, while this process is essential, it can often become tedious and can make even simple algorithms seem overly complex and hard to maintain. In this module, we will explore the use of framework providedconcurrent data structures shipped with the Task Parallel Library that will simplify multi­threaded code while maximising concurrency and efficiency.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704620","duration":3479,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

There are many inventive ways to make sure you can be a part of the IoT wave. Unfortunately a good part of the devices end up in the trash can due to many reasons. Flaky, unusable and intrusive are terms that often describe these devices.\nAre we trying to hard to put every device on the internet or is it the fallacy of the next big thing?\n\nThe world could sure use some enhancement, but that doesn't mean that every device in our home should be on the internet. Some of the most pushed devices are activity tracking and home automation, but we need to go even further. We will venture through the devices that can help us, and not skip the entire security aspect. How can can we mix and match sensors to create new and awesome things...behold IoT is

Talks: Einar Afiouni, Nicholas Paulik, Erling A Børresen, Jan Tore Stølsvik","description":"Einar Afiouni: Organising CSS, what can you do, what we did and what we learned from it\n\nWe recently had the opportunity to start fresh with CSS on a project, so we decided to take the opporunity to research what methodologies there are out there for CSS, what are their advantages and disadvantages and what we decided to go with as well as what we learned doing so. (We just started, but until NDC we will have enough time to see how it went, mistakes, regrets etc)\n\nNicholas Paulik: How I hacked my way to NDC\n\nIn January, I attended the conference Security Day 2016 in Oslo, with a plethora of awesome speakers and sessions. During the live Q&A session at the end of the day, I spontaneously tested the Q&A software for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, causing an unexpected dialog box to pop up on the big screen. Being a security conference, this was met with laughter and applause, and I was encouraged to give a lightning talk.\n\nThis lightning talk is based around the event, with focus on what made the exploit possible, how some common security mechanisms can be defeated, protection against cross-site scripting and how the vendor of theQ&A software responded.\n\nErling A Børresen: HTTP/2 – What's the deal?\n\nHTTP/2 was published as a RFC in may 2015. In this lightning talk I will take a (very) brief look at the history behind HTTP/2, what it is and how this new standard will change and improve the every day work of a web developer. The presentation is best suited for web developers who wants a quick summary of what HTTP/2 may bring to the table, without diving to much into the details about how it works under the hood.\n\nJan Tore Stølsvik: Forget data changing over time with React.js\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. React brings many good things to the table, but the best part by far, is the virtual DOM. With a virtual dom it has once again become possible to code frontend applications like the good old days, when for each request we simply re render the entire view. In this talk I will explain how this simplifies an application, makes it faster, more reusable and testable.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704610","duration":2335,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

But how long until you see it in production? For some teams, it can be months or even years. By the time your new feature or bug fix gets used in anger, you've forgotten what you did! But with a great deployment pipeline and some clever architecture, there's a better way.\nThis session is packed with war stories and real world successes. We'll walk through the realities of a no-touch deployment pipeline that you can trust all the way to production, and we'll examine some clever architectural patterns to enable true software agility. By the end, you'll be convinced that if it's not in production, it doesn't count. If you struggle to get updates in the hands of users, this is the session for you.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704607","duration":3456,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

We will have a look at some recent events that made the news, and dissect what went wrong, and what we can do about it for our applications.\nYou will see old attacks with a new twist, and modern ways to mess with a site.

their behavioral characteristics asking is they are concurrent, parallel, fault-tolerant, or real time and so on.\nIn this talk I'll talk about the different programming metaphors and the behavioral characteristics of commonly used languages and operating systems.\n\nI'll hope to show how use of an inappropriate metaphor can make simple problems embarrassingly difficult, and how hard problems

Be Dilbert: Survival Tactics for Uninspiring Workplaces - Kylie Hunt","description":"Let’s face it, the majority of work environments don’t exactly have us skipping on the way to work on a Monday morning. They’re just so… Dilbert. Managers who don’t understand what you do. Cookie-cutter. One-size-fits-all. But workplaces shouldn’t be where we go to work, they should be places we go to be inspired, to communicate, to be as productive as we possibly can be. A happy place.\nBut most workplaces aren’t happy places; most of us are not happy at work. I was one of those people with my very own Pointy Haired Boss and I want to help you do something about yours. This talk isn’t about turning your office into the Googleplex and now magically you’re in a fun workplace, but how you can influence your environment to help make you happier and more productive at work doing what you love. And who wouldn’t want to be happier at work?!","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704602","duration":2553,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

group. However, most industries are predominantly white male. Why?\nThe hardest possible thing is to know what you don’t know. Understand your bias. Being aware of your hidden biases can help you to look at things differently, to unlock completely different perspectives. Understand the challenges that women face in today’s industries. See how you can help to be more inclusive and create a more open and diverse culture where you

the Big Ball of Mud - Mathew McLoughlin","description":"Over the years I’ve seen many implementations of an n-tiered application with an anaemic domain model. You know the kind, presentation, service, data access layer. This architecture whilst quick to start building has its problems. Over time, as the application becomes more complex the codebase will become more and more difficult to maintain, often resulting in a ”Big Ball of Mud”.\nIn this talk I will present some ideas that address these maintainability problems using a solution with a domain model and command patterns to give you a clean extensible architecture. Further to this we will explore event sourcing and cqrs and the benefits they can bring.\n\nAt the end the you will have seen an alternative way of building business applications, especially those with complex business logic.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704597","duration":3261,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

in 2016 - How is our systems broken? - Chris Dale","description":"From zero to to hero - Total domination.\nIn this presentation, Chris Dale shows how a typical network is compromised through multiple levels of exploitation. The talk is very demo intensive and hands on, proving how an attacker with extremely limited access to an organization is still able to get a foothold, even with no apparent vulnerabilities present.\nOnce a foothold is gained, the attack surface increases. The attacker uses the increased attack surface to compromise further into the organisation, eventually gaining all the keys to the kingdom.\n\nIf you are curious on how a hacker accomplishes their goals, how they work and the attacks that take place, this hs the talk for you.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704596","duration":3472,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

World HoloLens Mixed Reality Development with Unity - Be Part of the Future - Rene Schulte","description":"With the fast developments of powerful Augmented, Mixed and Virtual reality devices like HoloLens science fiction movie technology is becoming reality for consumers.\nIn this session, Rene Schulte will talk to you about the challenges that AR and VR pose and why 3D is an essential part of this experience. Comprehensible demos will show how every developer can develop outstanding HoloLens solutions with Unity and be part of this computing revolution.\n\nWhen you leave this session, you will understand how to setup your Unity environment, what skills you need to create compelling HoloLens applications and what best practices will help you move forward quickly. Starting with a simple “MR Hello World” demo, we will use this to understand all of the pieces required to run your app. Last, but not least, we will demonstrate some of the applications that Rene and his team have been working on in the past few months, to give the viewers a sense of what can be accomplished with the right skill targeting one of the most anticipated devices in a while.\n\nWhen you leave this session, you will know the challenges we faced while building HoloLens apps and how we solved them. You will also have learned best practices and recommendations to avoid pit falls and you will hopefully be inspired to build your own HoloLens apps.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704584","duration":3621,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Piece of Cake - C# powered cross platform build automation - Gary Ewan Park","description":"Have you ever wanted to create a build script for your application, but been faced with learning a new language, or DSL, or writing more XML than any person should ever need to?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?\nIf you have answered yes to any of these questions, then the Cake (http://cakebuild.net/) Build Automation System is for you!In this session we will start with a standard .Net Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, using the C# skills that you may already have.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704581","duration":3288,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Locking in C++ -  Andrei Alexandrescu","description":"Lock-based synchronization continues to be a dominant technique for synchronizing multithreaded programs. Better support for multiple readers/single writer locks has made it more competitive. Furthermore, C++1x STL introduces special guarantees for containers aimed at better support for the readers/writer paradigm.\nHowever, lock-based synchronization still has well understood downsides such as proneness to races and deadlocks due to its poor integration with type systems. This talk discusses folly/Synchronized, a C++ library that provides reliable encapsulated locking for generic

web applications using F# and suave - Tomas Jansson","description":"The web is functional, so why not write web applications in a functional language? Suave is a lightweight, non-blocking web server implemented in and for F#. To get a web application up and running you only need a couple of lines of code compared to multiple classes and tons of boiler plate code in a standard .NET web application. The building blocks in suave are really small, and making custom ones is easy. You can chain the building blocks together forming one application using one simple operator. Suave also comes with features like typed routing for better safety, sockets, basic authentication and more.\nThis talk will show you how to get started with suave on Windows or Linux and create a 100

is not an Option- Building services with GRPC and Cassandra -  Dave Bechberger","description":"In today's development ecosystem building a service oriented architecture based on a micro services is common practice. With the rise of Big Data and Internet of Things applications making these services highly performant services is no longer an option. In order to accomplish the scalability and performance requirements that customers expect we are required to start thinking differently about how we architect and build these applications in order to meet those demands.\nThis session will demonstrate a method for creating a highly performant service based application using Google’s GRPC and Apache Cassandra in .NET. We will show how you can combine gRPC to minimize communication overhead while leveraging Cassandra to optimize storage of time series data. We will explore these concepts by creating an Internet of Things (IoT) application to demonstrate how you can effectively meet the performance and scalability challenges posed by these new breeds of applications.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704575","duration":3620,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

to do a really good product demo -  Katrin Grothues","description":"Working in middle to large companies means working with several scrum teams, different departments and having often far from ideal working communication processes. Product Management usually is only one piece of the greater picture and has to serve multiple stakeholders.\nKeeping the core stakeholders informed about the latest releases and achievements mostly works. But it becomes really hard to keep the rest of the company up to date.\nThat is an important issue especially if the core business model of the company consists of products driven by product management. Everyone in the company should know what latest functions and features the company brought to market and how these are working. But how?\n\nWhen I joined my company there has been a bi-weekly company wide product review. Goal was to achieve exactly this same information level. But – to be short – it sucked. It was boring and hard to understand for the audience, it had little information value and also for the product teams it was more like an appointment to the dentist than a stage to show their great work.\n\nI was given the opportunity to change that process. And we are now on a really good track.\n\nNow we still have a company wide product demo showing all our colleagues what product management released and what it achieved. But we moved from bullet-point-slides to live demos, from complaints about technical set up and length of the meeting to discussions about metrics. We are now able to give teams a stage and deliver valuable information to our colleagues.\n\nIn my talk I will line out where we started, what our main challenges have been and how we measured our progress on a regular basis and – step by step – came up with a satisfying format. We haven’t finished yet improving – but that’s not the goal. Because we want to continuous improve.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704570","duration":2908,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

data in the cloud? You can’t do that! - Rune Andreas Grimstad","description":"In my job I work with very sensitive medical information. The traditional view here is that this sensitivity excludes the cloud as a possible platform. I believe that this is not only wrong but also a very unfortunate limitation.\nIn this talk I want to look at this situation to discuss the background and then to look at what you can do to fix it. In my opinion there is nothing stopping you from handling sensitive data in the cloud, but you have to know what you are doing. The same requirements for data security applies for the cloud as for on premise systems, the main difference is how we perceive the cloud.\n\nThe focus of my talk will be on Microsoft Azure, but the principles are reusable across all platforms.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704567","duration":3086,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/171704567?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Sensitive data in the cloud?

devices.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704566","duration":2196,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

your favourite programming language, using a \"parser combinator\" library and concepts no more complicated than regular expressions. In this talk, we'll do a deep dive into parser combinators.\nWe'll build a parser combinator library from scratch in F# using functional programming techniques, and then use it to implement a full

to Cloud: Orleans Framework for building Halo-scale systems - Sergey Bykov","description":"Orleans is the next most popular open source project of the.NET Foundation after CoreCLR/CoreFX/Roslyn. It wascreated in Microsoft Research and is now developed within Microsoft Studios.\nOrleans has already redefined how modern scalable interactive cloud services and distributed systems should be built by introducing theVirtual Actor model.\nOrleans has been running in production since 2011 powering high throughput cloud services forHalo Reach, Halo 4, Age of Empires, Skype, Azure Monitoring, and several other Microsoft products. It is a bedrock technology for the cloud services ofHalo 5: Guardians. Since the public preview at Build 2014 and going open source in January 2015 Orleans got used by a significant number of customers ranging from small startups to large enterprises. At the same time, it attracted a group of talented engineers from companies around the globe that have formed a vibrantcommunity around the project. The Orleans core team maintains strong ties with Microsoft Research to keep the stream of innovations going.\n\nCome hear how you can leverage Orleans today, what's been recently added to it, what new functionality is coming soon, and about our future plans.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704564","duration":4014,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

UI Testing for iOS and Android Mobile Apps -  Karl Krukow","description":"An ever growing number of mobile devices with constantly advancing operating system releases are hitting the market at a lightning pace. Creating a comprehensive testing suite is imperative to success in the mobile market to ensure your app is of the highest quality with each and every release. Unit tests can only test your core business logic. How can you ensure your user interface is bulletproof and regression free on four versions of iOS on 20 devices or eight versions of android on over 18,000 device models! This is where creating automated user interface testing for mobile apps comes in.\nXamarin.UITest is a freely available testing framework that enables you to create user interface tests to programmatically interact with native and hybrid apps. Swipe, tap, or rotate any user interface element and then perform real world assertions and take screenshots for visual validation along the way. Learn how to create these tests and run them locally on your own device or simulator or take them to the Xamarin Test Cloud to automatically test your application on thousands of physical devices ensuring mobile success.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704557","duration":3510,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe

Data Security : Hope is not a Strategy - Stephen Haunts","description":"Not encrypting your data is a risky move and just relying on hope that you wont get hacked and compromised is not a strategy.\nAs a software developer you have a duty to your employer to secure and protect their data. In this talk, you will learn how to use the .NET Framework to protect your data to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authentication.\nThis talk covers random number generation, hashing, authenticated hashing, and password based key derivation functions. The talk also covers both symmetric and asymmetric encryption using DES, Triple DES, AES, and RSA. You then learn how to combine these all together to product a hybrid encryption scheme which includes AES, RSA, HMACS, and Digital Signatures.","link":"https://vimeo.com/171704556","duration":3113,"width":1280,"language":"en","height":720,"embed":{"html":"<iframe
